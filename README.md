# Shopping List

This is a basic shopping list app built using Vite + Redux + React + TypeScript. It accesses an AWS API Gateway, running Lambda functions to access data from an AWS RDS. This is a practice project to learn the basics of each of these techologies. Different lists are stored by giving the site different names, and settings such as "display purchased items" and which items are purchased are saved as well.
